\chapter{Common Machine Learning algorithms}\label{ch:introduction}

This chapter is dedicated to the most common ML algorithms, a major part of the notes come from the mml-books.com \todo{Add bibtex reference}

\section{Linear Regression}

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

\subsubsection*{Closed-Form Solution}

\paragraph*{Problem to Solve}

\paragraph*{Algorithm}

\paragraph*{Properties}

\paragraph*{Use Cases}

% \section{Examples}
% You can also have examples in your document such as in example~\ref{ex:simple_example}.
% \begin{example}{An Example of an Example}
%   \label{ex:simple_example}
%   Here is an example with some math
%   \begin{equation}
%     0 = \exp(i\pi)+1\ .
%   \end{equation}
%   You can adjust the colour and the line width in the {\tt macros.tex} file.
% \end{example}

% \section{How Does Sections, Subsections, and Subsections Look?}
% Well, like this
% \subsection{This is a Subsection}
% and this
% \subsubsection{This is a Subsubsection}
% and this.

% \paragraph{A Paragraph}
% You can also use paragraph titles which look like this.

% \subparagraph{A Subparagraph} Moreover, you can also use subparagraph titles which look like this\todo{Is it possible to add a subsubparagraph?}. They have a small indentation as opposed to the paragraph titles.
