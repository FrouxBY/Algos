This document is currently under developement and none of the chapter are finish, nor in a good shape. 

This Document is a simple survey of the Machine Learning and AI method that I encounter. Most of it are based on lecture notes from my dual MSc between CentraleSup√©lec and Imperial College. The first goal is to be used as a personnal reminder of what I have already encounter and understood. 

The exemple below \todo{Link figure} is a scheme wich classify the machine learning algorithms in a certain way. This document does not follow this classification. 
All the definition and concept will not be explains, as a lot of ressources are available on those subjects (Computer Sciences benefits from the most open-sourced field in research). Sometimes ressources might provided, but the reader is invited to look himself for the subjects he does not understand well.
