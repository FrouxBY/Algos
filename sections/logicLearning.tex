		\subsection{Introduction to Concept Learning}

			In Concept Learning we aim to compute a definition of a concept, expressed in a given langage (called \emph{hypothesis space}) that satisfies positive exemple and none of negatives ones. As an exemple, it can be a regexp which can match all words of a set, and none of an other set (see Regexp Golf)
