	Argument Framework are a field in AI which provide way of evaluate any debate problem. It is useful to resolve conflict, to explain decision or to deal with incomplete information.

\section{Abstract Argumentation}

	\subsection{Simple AA}

		\begin{definition}
		 		an  \textbf{AA framework} is a set $\mathrm{Args}$ of arguments and a binary relation $\mathrm{attacks}$. $(\alpha, \beta)\in \mathrm{attacks}$ means $\alpha$ attacks $\beta$.
		\end{definition} 

		\paragraph{Semantics in AA} 
			In order to define a "winning" set of argument, we need to provide semantics over the the framework. This is like recipes which determine good set of arguments. 

		\begin{definition}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{conflict-free}
				\item \textbf{admissible:} c-f and attacks each attacking argument.
				\item \textbf{preferred:} maximally admissible.
				\item \textbf{complete:} admissible + contains each argument it defends.
				\item \textbf{stable:} c-f + attacks each argument not in it.
				\item \textbf{grounded:} minimally complete.
				\item \textbf{sceptically preferred:} Intersection of all prefered.
				\item \textbf{ideal:} maximal admissible and containing all prefered.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{definition}

		\begin{definition}
			\textbf{Semi-stable extension:} complete such as $A\cup A^+$ is maximal. $A^+$ is the set of attacked argument by $A$.
		\end{definition}

	\subsection{Algorithms for AA}

		\paragraph{Computing the grounded labelling:}
		Here is an algorithm to compute a grounded labelling\\
		\begin{algorithm}[H]
		\KwData{An AA Framework}
		\KwResult{The grounded Labelling}
		Label all unatacked argument with IN \;
		\While{The IN and the OUT are not stable}
		{
			Label OUT the arguments attacks by IN \;
			Label IN the arguments only attacked by OUT\;
		}
		Label the still unlabelled UNDEC\;
		\caption{Computing the grounded labelling}
		\end{algorithm}

		\paragraph{Computing membership in preferred/grounded/ideal extensions;} In order to compute membership, we use Dispute Tree.

		We compute a dispute tree for an argument, and apply the different semantics which are easier to compute on a tree than on a graph.
		\todo{add algos of computing dispute tree + def of semantics}

		\paragraph{Computing stable extension:} We use answer set programming with logical program. 
		

	\subsection{AA with Suppport}

		\subsubsection[BAA]{Bipolar Abstract Argumentation}
			We add a \textbf{Support} relation to a classic AA Framework. There are different semantics, but we focus here one the QuAD (\textbf{Quantitative Argument Debate}) which add a numerical strenght to any argument, and give rule for updating strenght regarding the supporters or attackers.
